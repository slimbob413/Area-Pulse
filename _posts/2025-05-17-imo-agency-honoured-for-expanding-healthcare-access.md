Abuja: The Imo State Health Insurance Agency (IMSHIA) has been recognised by the Institute for Managed Care and Health Insurance for its contributions to improving access to healthcare in the state. The award, presented on Tuesday in Abuja, was titled ‘Best Health Insurance and Managed Care Government Agency in Provider Network and Performance Management 2025’. This recognition highlights the state’s progress in expanding health coverage and reducing financial hardship for patients.

According to News Agency of Nigeria, Dr Uchenna Ewelike, Executive Secretary of the agency, expressed gratitude to the Institute for the recognition. He described it as a testament to the state’s commitment to delivering quality healthcare under the leadership of Gov. Hope Uzodinma. He emphasised the state’s efforts to ensure residents have access to quality health services without financial hardship, aligning with Governor Uzodinma’s shared prosperity vision.

Ewelike stated that the state’s health insurance programme has been instrumental in reducing maternal and child mortality and safeguarding public and civil servants through comprehensive health coverage. The governor has also extended the programme to pensioners and vulnerable groups, providing support to those in need.

He further explained that Gov. Uzodinma has consistently paid premiums for civil servants and has commenced payments for pensioners. Millions of Naira have been allocated to equity funds for the poor and vulnerable. These initiatives have addressed significant barriers to healthcare access, particularly in rural or underserved areas.

The executive secretary credited the governor’s leadership with fostering a more inclusive and sustainable health system in Imo. The agency has expanded healthcare access through four key programmes: coverage for civil servants, support for the poor and vulnerable via the Basic Health Care Provision Fund (BHCPF), a rebranded student health insurance scheme, and ImoCare for the informal sector.

Ewelike noted that from zero enrolment in 2022, the agency now covers about 3.4 per cent of the state’s population. This progress is attributed to stakeholder confidence, the dedication of the IMSHIA team, and the governor’s support. The agency has managed 381,394 cases under the BHCPF alone, with a monthly utilisation rate of 35 to 40 per cent.

Between April 2023 and April 2025, over 4,000 deliveries were recorded, including about 1,200 caesarean sections, with only one maternal death. Similar achievements were noted under other programmes, with more than 12,000 cases managed, preventing financial ruin for many families due to health expenses.

Ewelike expressed hope that the agency would continue on this path and earn further recognition in the coming year. He emphasised the importance of continued efforts for improved access to health services for the people of Imo.

Earlier, Dr Hope Uweja, Chairman of the Institute, commended the establishment of State Health Insurance Schemes across Nigeria as key drivers in the pursuit of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). With eight years of experience in the sector, he praised these schemes for their role in expanding health insurance coverage.

The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the event featured goodwill messages from Dr Salma Anas, Special Adviser to the President on Health; Dr Yusuf Sununu, Minister of State for Humanitarian Affairs; and representatives from various states.
