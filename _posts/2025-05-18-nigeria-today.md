The country's burgeoning tech industry is not only creating new opportunities for economic growth but also posing challenges that call for thoughtful policy development. As the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria's embrace of AI and other emerging technologies could serve as a model for the continent, with the potential to transform everything from agriculture to healthcare, and drive innovation in a rapidly changing global economy.

The Nigerian government has recognized the importance of AI, initiating policies to foster an environment conducive to tech startups and innovation.
