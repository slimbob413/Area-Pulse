Nigerian policymakers, tech entrepreneurs, and a vibrant youth population are at the helm. What is the course they've set? A digital economy poised for expansion, with a focus on innovation, infrastructure, and inclusive policies. Why does this matter for Nigerians?

In the crossroads of technology and policy lies the blueprint for a Nigeria that is innovative, inclusive, and influential on the world stage.
