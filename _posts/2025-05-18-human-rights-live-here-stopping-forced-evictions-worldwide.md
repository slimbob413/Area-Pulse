A new international campaign, "Human Rights Live Here," aims to put an end to the scourge of forced evictions, casting a spotlight on a dire global issue that hits close to home for many Nigerians. In Nigeria, where urban development often translates into the displacement of impoverished communities, this initiative speaks to the heart of ongoing local struggles. Forced evictions in Nigeria not only disrupt lives but also violate fundamental human rights, a pattern observed in numerous countries where the campaign is gaining traction. By advocating for the rights of the marginalized, "Human Rights Live Here" brings together activists, legal experts, and policy-makers to ensure that the right to adequate housing is respected worldwide.

> "The 'Human Rights Live Here' campaign is a beacon of hope, heralding a new era where forced evictions are no longer tolerated as a byproduct of development," said Amina Jibril, a human rights advocate from the Nigerian Tribune. 

The relevance of the campaign for Nigerians cannot be overstated as the country grapples with a housing deficit estimated at over 17 million units, according to the World Bank. The stark disparity between the affluent and the poor in urban centers like Lagos presents a recurring challenge for inclusive development. As such, the "Human Rights Live Here" movement's mission to halt forced evictions is not just an international concernâ€”it is an imperative for Nigeria's growth and adherence to human rights.
