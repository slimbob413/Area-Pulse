A global initiative is making strides in stopping forced evictions, a critical issue affecting vulnerable populations worldwide including Nigeria. 'Human rights live here' is not just a slogan but a call to action for policymakers and activists who are working tirelessly to end the practice of forced evictions, which often lead to homelessness and violations of human dignity. In Nigeria, where rapid urbanization and infrastructural development sometimes result in the displacement of entire communities, this movement is particularly pertinent. It emphasizes the need for development policies that prioritize human rights and ensure that no one is forcibly removed from their homes without due process and adequate compensation.

> "The 'Human rights live here' campaign is a testament to the power of collective action. It's vital that we protect our communities from the trauma of forced evictions, which can have devastating long-term effects on their well-being," says Amina Jibril, a human rights advocate at the Social and Economic Rights Action Center.

As the campaign gains momentum, it's clear that the fight against forced evictions is a fight for the very soul of our cities and towns. By ensuring that human rights are embedded in every brick and policy, 'Human rights live here' is creating a blueprint for sustainable and equitable urban development. This is a message that resonates deeply with Nigerians, who are all too familiar with the struggles of securing a place to call home in the face of development pressures. The take-away is clear: human rights must be at the center of our urban future in Nigeria.
