A global initiative aptly titled "Human rights live here" is making significant strides in preventing forced evictions, a practice that has affected millions worldwide and is of particular concern in Nigeria. The movement, spearheaded by a coalition of NGOs and civil society organizations, addresses the urgent need to protect vulnerable populations from being displaced without proper due process or adequate alternative housing. In Nigeria, where urban development often precedes at the expense of informal settlements, the campaign resonates with the struggles of many communities facing the threat of forced eviction.

> "This initiative is not just about stopping evictions; it's about affirming the dignity of every individual and the right to have a safe place to call home," states Kemi Ogunniyi, a senior researcher at the Centre for Housing Rights and Evictions. 

As Nigerians grapple with the complexities of urbanization and development, the "Human rights live here" initiative provides a blueprint for integrating human rights into housing policies. It is a reminder that development should not come at the cost of human dignity and that every individual deserves a place to live in peace and security. The campaign's impact in Nigeria could serve as a model for other countries facing similar challenges, highlighting the need for a balanced approach to development that prioritizes human rights.
