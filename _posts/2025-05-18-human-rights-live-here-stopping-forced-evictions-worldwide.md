A global movement aptly named "Human Rights Live Here" is setting a new standard in the fight against forced evictions, a practice that has affected millions worldwide, including Nigerians. This initiative, spearheaded by a coalition of human rights organizations, leverages legal advocacy, public policy intervention, and community mobilization to prevent the displacement of vulnerable populations. In Nigeria, where forced evictions have been a longstanding issue, often to make way for development projects without adequate compensation or resettlement, this movement is particularly relevant. The campaign not only challenges the legality of such evictions but also works to instill the principle that housing is a fundamental human right.

> "The 'Human Rights Live Here' campaign has been instrumental in shaping policies and attitudes towards housing as a human right. It's a beacon of hope for those at risk of losing their homes and livelihoods," says Amina Jibril, a policy analyst at the Centre for Housing Rights and Evictions.

In Nigeria, the influence of "Human Rights Live Here" has been felt in various states, with some government bodies beginning to reconsider and amend their approaches to urban development. The campaign has become a rallying point for communities, providing a platform for those affected to voice their concerns and seek justice. As the movement grows, its impact on Nigerian society is expected to deepen, potentially leading to more humane and rights-respecting urban planning policies.

The commitment to stop forced evictions worldwide by "Human Rights Live Here" not only reflects a shift in the international human rights landscape but also underscores the importance of safeguarding the dignity and rights of individuals in Nigeria.
