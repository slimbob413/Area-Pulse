In a bold move to protect vulnerable populations, the 'Human rights live here' campaign has taken a definitive stand against forced evictions globally. The initiative, which has garnered international support, is particularly relevant to Nigerians, where forced evictions are not uncommon and often result in the displacement of thousands without adequate notice or compensation. Advocates argue that such practices not only disrupt lives but also violate fundamental human rights, calling for policies that prioritize the welfare of citizens over urban development agendas.

> "Forced evictions are an affront to human dignity and a direct violation of international human rights law. 'Human rights live here' stands as a beacon of hope, urging governments to adopt just and humane housing policies." - Nneka Okonkwo, Human Rights Watch Africa.

In Nigeria, the fight against forced evictions resonates deeply. 'Human rights live here' has been instrumental in amplifying the voices of affected communities, advocating for legal reforms, and providing legal assistance to resist unlawful evictions. With a focus on policy change and community empowerment, the campaign has highlighted the critical need for a balance between development and human rights protections.

Ending forced evictions is more than a moral imperative; it's a legal one that 'Human rights live here' is championing, with implications that could transform the lives of countless Nigerians. The initiative's work underscores the importance of respecting and safeguarding the rights of all individuals, ensuring that human rights truly have a place to live, including in Nigeria.
