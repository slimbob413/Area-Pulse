Forced evictions, a scourge on the right to adequate housing, are being challenged globally by the 'Human rights live here' campaign. In Nigeria, where urban development often clashes with the rights of vulnerable populations, this initiative has been a beacon of hope. It matters to Nigerians who have witnessed or endured the trauma of forced evictions, which disproportionately affect the poor and marginalized, leading to a cycle of poverty and homelessness. The campaign works by leveraging international pressure, policy advocacy, and legal assistance to protect those at risk.

> "The success of 'Human rights live here' is a testament to what can be achieved when global solidarity meets local action. Itâ€™s about ensuring that development does not come at the expense of the most vulnerable," says Amina J. Mohammed, United Nations Deputy Secretary-General.

The results have been telling, with a notable decrease in the number of forced evictions and a rise in community-driven development projects. For Nigeria, this marks a critical juncture where human rights are not just theoretical ideals, but tangible realities shaping the urban landscape. The campaign's continued success could serve as a model for other nations grappling with similar issues, underlining the importance of human rights in the fabric of urban development. As Nigeria's experience demonstrates, the right to a home is universal and must be defended with unwavering commitment.
