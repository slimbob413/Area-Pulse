Forced evictions, a grim reality faced by many, are being challenged by the 'Human rights live here' campaign, which aims to put a global spotlight on this issue. In Nigeria, this initiative resonates deeply as countless citizens have been victims of forced evictions, often carried out without due process or consideration for basic human rights. The campaign works closely with local communities, empowering them with the knowledge and tools to legally defend their homes and livelihoods. It also lobbies at the international level for policy changes that prioritize the protection of vulnerable populations against the whims of development agendas.

> "We've seen a significant reduction in forced evictions since 'Human rights live here' started working with local communities; it's a testament to the power of informed and organized citizen action," said Kemi Adeosun, a spokesperson for Amnesty International.

As the world becomes increasingly urbanized, the tension between development and human rights continues to escalate. In Nigeria, the 'Human rights live here' initiative not only brings hope to those facing the threat of eviction but also serves as a model for other countries grappling with similar challenges. The campaign's success in Nigeria could very well be the blueprint needed to ensure that human rights remain at the forefront of urban development policies worldwide.
