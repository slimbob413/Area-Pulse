Human rights live here has become a mantra for activists fighting against forced evictions, a practice that has torn apart communities worldwide, including Nigeria. In Nigeria, this movement resonates deeply as forced evictions are not just a violation of human rights but also exacerbate poverty and social inequality. The collective action spearheaded by NGOs, civil society, and international bodies has been instrumental in bringing these issues to the forefront of global policy discussions. The movement's efforts have led to legal victories, policy reforms, and increased awareness, ensuring that the rights of the vulnerable are not overlooked in the face of rapid urban development and economic pressures.

> "The fight against forced evictions is not just about protecting homes; it's about safeguarding the dignity and future of every individual," says Amina J. Mohammed, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, highlighting the global resonance of the campaign.

As Human rights live here continues to make strides in preventing forced evictions, its impact is felt on the local ground in Nigeriaâ€”providing a beacon of hope for those at risk of losing their homes and livelihoods. It's a reminder that the protection of human rights is a universal concern, and Nigeria remains at the heart of this global advocacy, striving for a world where forced evictions are a thing of the past.
