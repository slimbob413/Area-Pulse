A global initiative aptly named "Human Rights Live Here" is gaining traction by advocating for the cessation of forced evictions, a pertinent issue for countless Nigerian households. In Nigeria, the practice of forced eviction is not uncommon, often leaving families homeless and disrupting communities without adequate legal recourse or compensation. This movement, which has garnered international support, emphasizes the protection of the vulnerable and the promotion of sustainable development policies that respect the rights of residents.

> "Forced evictions are not just about lost homes, they're about broken communities and shattered lives. 'Human Rights Live Here' represents a beacon of hope for those who have long suffered from these injustices," says Amina Lawal, a prominent activist reported by The Guardian Nigeria.

The campaign's relevance for Nigerians is profound, considering the country's history with forced evictions, such as the Otodo Gbame demolition in Lagos. By highlighting the plight of affected communities and advocating for policy reforms, "Human Rights Live Here" endeavors to ensure that human dignity is upheld in urban development. The initiative's work is a reminder that, across the globe and in Nigeria, the right to a home should be inalienable and protected for all.
