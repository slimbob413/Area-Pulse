A global halt to forced evictions marks a win for human rights, resonating deeply with communities in Nigeria. The "Human rights live here" campaign has gained momentum, establishing a worldwide front against the practice of forced evictions, often targeted at vulnerable populations. In Nigeria, where such evictions have displaced thousands, this movement has been crucial in providing a platform for advocacy and legal resistance. It matters because it aligns with the fundamental rights enshrined in the Nigerian Constitution, and it offers a beacon of hope for those who have faced or are at risk of eviction.

> "The collective efforts of grassroots organizations and international bodies have put a spotlight on forced evictions, compelling governments to uphold human dignity," said Amina Jibril, a human rights lawyer, in an interview with The Guardian Nigeria.

This international policy shift carries significant weight for Nigerian citizens, as it supports the country's ongoing struggle to balance urban development with the protection of its citizens' rights. The "Human rights live here" initiative is more than a slogan; it's a growing shield against the bulldozers of injustice, reinforcing the message that every Nigerian has the right to a secure home.
