In an era where forced evictions have become a distressing human rights issue, the "Human rights live here" initiative is making strides to halt such practices worldwide. This movement has become particularly relevant for Nigerians, where forced evictions have not only displaced thousands but also highlighted the tension between urban development and the rights of the urban poor. By leveraging international human rights laws and engaging with local communities, this initiative is helping to safeguard the homes and livelihoods of vulnerable populations, shedding light on the importance of human rights in the context of urban planning and development.

> "The Nigerian experience with forced evictions is a stark reminder of the urgent need for global intervention. 'Human rights live here' provides a blueprint for resistance and legal recourse that can empower communities and challenge the status quo," says Amina Umar, a policy analyst with the Nigerian Institute for Social Justice.

As "Human rights live here" gains momentum, its implications for Nigeria are profound, promising a future where development projects are carried out with human dignity at their core. This initiative symbolizes a growing international commitment to ensuring that human rights are not sidelined in the face of rapid urbanization and that the voices of the marginalized are heard. It's a reminder that in Nigeria and beyond, the right to a home is fundamental.
