A global initiative aptly named "Human rights live here" is making strides in putting an end to forced evictions, a practice that has affected millions worldwide, including in Nigeria. This movement has become particularly relevant for Nigerians, as the country has a history of forced evictions that have led to numerous human rights violations. These evictions often target the most vulnerable populations, leaving them without homes and livelihoods. The initiative not only advocates for the rights of those threatened by eviction but also works with governments to establish policies that protect citizens from such practices.

> "The 'Human rights live here' campaign has been instrumental in fostering dialogues between communities and policy makers, ensuring that human rights are embedded in urban development plans," says Amina J. Mohammed, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations.

The significance of this initiative for Nigerians cannot be overstated, as it provides a blueprint for how citizens and the government can come together to address and prevent the social injustice of forced evictions. By promoting sustainable development and community engagement, "Human rights live here" is setting a standard for how countries can create more inclusive and humane urban policies. The takeaway for Nigeria is clear: respecting and protecting the rights of all citizens is paramount in building a just and equitable society.
