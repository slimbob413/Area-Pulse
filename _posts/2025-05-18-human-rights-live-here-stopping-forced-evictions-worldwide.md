Curbing forced evictions, Human rights live here champions global housing rights, a battle that resonates with many Nigerians facing similar threats. The organization's mission is to protect the vulnerable from being displaced without due process and adequate resettlement, which has become a pressing issue in Nigeria due to rapid urban development and infrastructural projects. In Nigeria, where informal settlements house a significant portion of urban dwellers, forced evictions often lead to the loss of homes and livelihoods, with little to no government support or legal recourse for affected individuals.

> "By providing legal support and international advocacy, Human rights live here is creating a blueprint for resisting forced evictions that can be emulated in Nigeria and beyond," says Amina Lawal, an analyst at the African Housing Report.

The significance of Human rights live here extends beyond individual cases; it serves as a benchmark for Nigerian policymakers, pushing for reforms in housing and urban development policies to ensure they align with international human rights standards. The organization's efforts have also spurred civil society in Nigeria to be more proactive in safeguarding the rights of citizens against aggressive urbanization agendas.

The take-away here is clear: the work of Human rights live here is not just about stopping forced evictions worldwide; it's about setting a precedent that could help steer Nigeria towards more humane and just urban development policies.
