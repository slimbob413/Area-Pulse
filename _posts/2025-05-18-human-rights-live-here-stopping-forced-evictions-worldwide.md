In an unprecedented global effort, 'Human rights live here' is spearheading the fight against forced evictions, a critical issue impacting millions. In Nigeria, where urban development often comes with a human cost, this initiative is a beacon of hope for those vulnerable to displacement. By leveraging international law and grassroots activism, 'Human rights live here' is working to ensure that development projects do not trample on the rights of the poor, advocating for policy reforms that protect residents from being uprooted without due process or adequate compensation.

> "The right to adequate housing is fundamental, and forced evictions undermine this basic human need. Our collective action is crucial in safeguarding communities and upholding human dignity," states Nkem Ifejika, a renowned human rights advocate from the BBC.

For Nigerians, the work of 'Human rights live here' resonates deeply, offering a template for balancing infrastructural growth with the preservation of human rights. It is a reminder that progress does not have to come at the expense of the vulnerable, and that every individual deserves a place to call home. This initiative's impact on Nigeria could potentially transform the landscape of urban development, ensuring that human rights are at the forefront of progress.
