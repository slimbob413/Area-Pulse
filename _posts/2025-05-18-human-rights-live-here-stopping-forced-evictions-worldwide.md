A global fight against forced evictions gains momentum as the 'Human rights live here' campaign champions the rights of millions facing displacement. In Nigeria, this movement is particularly relevant; forced evictions are not just a violation of human rights but also a catalyst for deeper social and economic crises. Families in cities like Lagos and Port Harcourt have frequently faced the trauma of sudden, government-led evictions, often without adequate notice, compensation, or alternative housing. This campaign resonates with the lived experience of many Nigerians, who see their rights trampled in the face of rapid urban development and infrastructural projects.

"Every individual has the right to adequate housing and the security of tenure, and forced evictions blatantly undermine these fundamental rights," says Amina J. Mohammed, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, speaking on the global imperative to combat housing injustices. The campaign's efforts align with broader international human rights laws and treaties, which Nigeria is a signatory to, thereby amplifying its responsibility to uphold these standards within its borders.

The significance of the 'Human rights live here' initiative extends beyond advocacy; it is a call to action for policy reform and a more humane approach to urban development in Nigeria. By highlighting the plight of those affected and the violation of international human rights law, the campaign echoes a sentiment that is increasingly hard to ignore: the necessity to protect the vulnerable from forced evictions in Nigeria and worldwide.
