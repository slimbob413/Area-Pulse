The global initiative 'Human rights live here' has taken a firm stand against the practice of forced evictions, a concern that hits close to home for many Nigerians. In a country where urban development often clashes with the livelihoods of marginalized communities, this program's advocacy and legal interventions offer a glimmer of hope. The initiative works with local NGOs, leveraging international human rights laws to protect the rights of Nigerian citizens, ensuring that development does not come at the expense of the vulnerable.

> "The right to adequate housing is not just a dreamâ€”it's a legal standard that governments must meet. 'Human rights live here' ensures that this standard is upheld, and forced evictions are recognized as the human rights violations they are," said Kemi Ogunyemi, an attorney with the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP).

By drawing attention to the plight of those at risk of forced evictions and holding governments accountable, 'Human rights live here' is making strides in safeguarding the rights of those who are often voiceless. This initiative not only impacts Nigeria but also sets a precedent for global human rights advocacy, emphasizing that development should not override fundamental human rights. As 'Human rights live here' gains momentum, it's poised to create a ripple effect of policy changes that protect citizens' homes and heritage, a movement that is deeply significant for Nigeria.
