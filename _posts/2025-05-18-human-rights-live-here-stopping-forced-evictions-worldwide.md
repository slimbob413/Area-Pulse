In the fight against the global scourge of forced evictions, the "Human rights live here" initiative is making significant strides. For Nigerians, who have historically faced numerous instances of forced evictions due to rapid urbanization and infrastructural development, the success of this initiative could mean the difference between displacement and stability. "Human rights live here" not only challenges the legality of such evictions but also works with local authorities to ensure that development does not come at the cost of basic human rights. The initiative has been instrumental in creating a dialogue between affected communities, government bodies, and developers, advocating for policies that protect the rights of the most vulnerable.

> "This initiative is not just about preventing unlawful evictions; it's about affirming the dignity of every individual and the importance of community in the face of development," said Amina J. Mohammed, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, in a statement to Al Jazeera.

As the program gains traction, it offers a beacon of hope for many Nigerians who are at risk of losing their homes and livelihoods. It is a reminder that even as nations pursue growth, the rights and voices of their citizens must not be sidelined. The success of "Human rights live here" in stopping forced evictions worldwide will undoubtedly serve as a template for balancing progress with the preservation of human rights in Nigeria and beyond.
