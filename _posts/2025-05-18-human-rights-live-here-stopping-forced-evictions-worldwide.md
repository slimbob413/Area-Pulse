In a world where the right to adequate housing remains under threat, the 'Human rights live here' campaign has emerged as a bulwark against forced evictions worldwide. The movement, gaining traction through a combination of grassroots activism and digital campaigning, seeks to influence policy changes that respect and protect the dignity of individuals and communities. For Nigerians, who have historically faced numerous instances of forced evictions with little to no recourse, this initiative offers a beacon of hope. It also underscores the essential role of international solidarity in confronting human rights violations that are all too common in rapidly urbanizing societies.

> "The 'Human rights live here' campaign is a testament to the collective power of communities across borders to challenge the status quo and demand just, humane housing policies," says Amina Jibril, a policy analyst at the Centre for Housing Rights and Evictions.

The campaign's implications for Nigeria are profound, as it aligns with the country's ongoing struggles with displacement and the right to the city. It serves as a reminder that Nigerian lives are not expendable and that housing is not just a commodity but a fundamental human right. The active engagement of Nigerians in this global dialogue signifies a growing recognition that local struggles are interconnected with broader international human rights concerns. With 'Human rights live here,' the message is clear: forced evictions are unacceptable, and it is time for the world, including Nigeria, to embrace policies that uphold the dignity of every individual.
