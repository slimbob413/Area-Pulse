In an era where evictions are increasingly weaponized against the vulnerable, the initiative 'Human rights live here' is taking a resolute stand against the practice, globally. This movement is particularly relevant to Nigeria, a country where forced evictions are not uncommon, often leading to human rights violations and exacerbating the plight of the underprivileged. The campaign advocates for policy reforms, provides legal support to affected communities, and works to ensure that the basic human right to adequate housing is respected and protected.

> "The fight against forced evictions is a fight for human dignity, and 'Human rights live here' aims to uphold this principle in Nigeria and beyond," said Amina Jibril, a representative for Amnesty International. 

The significance of this initiative is amplified in the context of Nigeria's socio-political landscape, where rapid urbanization and infrastructural development are sometimes pursued at the expense of citizens' rights. By highlighting the voices of those impacted and holding governments accountable, 'Human rights live here' fosters a global dialogue on the importance of respecting and upholding housing rights. As the movement gains momentum, it offers a beacon of hope for countless Nigerians, affirming that their rights matter and that their homes should be sanctuaries, not sites of insecurity.
