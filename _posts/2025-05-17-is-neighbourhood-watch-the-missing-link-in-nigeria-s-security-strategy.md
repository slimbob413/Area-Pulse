Abuja: Insecurity in Nigeria has evolved into a national crisis, touching nearly every part of the country. From the Maitatsine riots of the early 1980s to the enduring Boko Haram insurgency, the nation’s security challenges have deepened, albeit successive efforts to curb them. As traditional military solutions yield limited results, stakeholders are calling for alternative, community-led approaches. One of such is the implementation of a neighbourhood watch programme.

According to News Agency of Nigeria, Nigeria’s descent into widespread insecurity can be traced back to the Maitatsine uprising in Kano state during the Second Republic under President Shehu Shagari. At the time, the violence was seen as a temporary phase of unrest under a young democratic government. However, the emergence of Boko Haram in 2009 marked the beginning of a more entrenched conflict. Originating in the North-East, the insurgency has since spilled into other regions, evolving into a prolonged armed struggle and humanitarian crisis
. It has destabilised the Lake Chad region, with repercussions felt in Cameroon, Chad, and Niger.

A 2025 report by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlights that the activities of various armed groups, including bandits and kidnappers, are closely tied to the Boko Haram conflict. The report reflects that since 2011, persistent violence between herders and farmers, mainly over access to scarce resources, has escalated in central and north-western Nigeria. These groups have committed numerous atrocities, including murder, rape, kidnapping, and organised cattle rustling. Large areas of farmland have been seized by armed bandits, leaving many farmers too fearful to cultivate their land.

In response, the Nigerian government has launched several initiatives to push back against these non-state actors and protect the rights of citizens.
