Amidst the clamor for transparency and due process, "The ungolden silence of NJC on Imo judiciary" casts a shadow over Nigeria's commitment to judicial integrity.

The Nigerian Judicial Council (NJC), the body responsible for the administration of the judiciary, has been notably silent on the recent controversies surrounding the Imo State judiciary. This silence raises critical questions about who is accountable for the judiciary's actions and decisions, what the implications of this silence are, and why it matters for every Nigerian.

The NJC's lack of response comes at a time when Imo State's judiciary has faced allegations of corruption, abuse of power, and political interference. This silence is particularly concerning because it undermines public confidence in the judicial system, which is the cornerstone of democracy and rule of law in Nigeria.

Justice reform activists and legal experts have criticized the NJC's inaction. A prominent legal scholar at the University of Lagos, Prof. Akin Oyebode, stated, "The NJC's silence is not golden; it is indeed a disservice to the principles of justice and undermines the public's trust in our legal institutions."

In a nation where the judiciary is expected to be the last hope of the common man, the silence of the NJC on issues within the Imo judiciary opens up a Pandora's box of skepticism about the impartiality and autonomy of the judiciary in Nigeria. The takeaway for Nigerians is clear: the health of our democracy hinges on a judiciary that is not just independent in name, but also audacious and transparent in action.
