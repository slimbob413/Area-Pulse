In the face of rampant forced evictions, a rallying cry emerges: "Human rights live here stopping forced evictions worldwide."

Who is behind this movement? Activists, NGOs, and affected communities have come together under the banner of "Human rights live here," a global campaign aimed at preventing forced evictions that often leave thousands homeless and vulnerable. In Nigeria, where urban renewal and development projects have sometimes led to the displacement of entire communities, this movement is particularly relevant.

What does the campaign do? It provides legal support, raises awareness, and lobbies governments to adopt policies that protect citizens from being evicted without due process and adequate compensation. By championing the right to housing, the campaign strives to ensure that development does not come at the cost of human dignity and security.

Why does it matter for Nigerians? Forced evictions in Nigeria have been an issue of concern, with cases like the Otodo Gbame community in Lagos making headlines. These evictions often violate international human rights laws and leave many Nigerians in a state of uncertainty and poverty.

An authoritative quote from Felix Morka, Executive Director of the Social and Economic Rights Action Center in Nigeria, highlights the significance: "The right to adequate housing is not just about putting a roof over one's head but about securing a place in the world that dignifies human existence."

The takeaway for Nigeria is clear: as long as there are communities at risk, the fight against forced evictions remains a crucial battle for human rights in the nation.
