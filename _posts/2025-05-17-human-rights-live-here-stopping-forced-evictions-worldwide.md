Forced evictions are a glaring violation of human rights, and a new global campaign, Human Rights Live Here, is gaining traction in its fight to end this practice. In Nigeria, where urban development often translates to the displacement of underprivileged communities, the campaign resonates deeply. It not only addresses the loss of homes but also the subsequent effects on livelihoods, education, and access to healthcare that many Nigerians face. The international solidarity shown through this initiative amplifies local voices, pushing for policy changes and legal reforms that prioritize human dignity over economic interests.

> "The right to adequate housing is universal, and forced evictions undermine this fundamental principle. We stand with communities in Nigeria and around the world in their fight for justice and security," says Kemi Adeosun, Human Rights Watch.

As the campaign picks up steam, it is essential for Nigerians to recognize the power of collective action in safeguarding their rights. Human Rights Live Here reminds us that, beyond the borders of Nigeria, there is a shared struggle for human dignity, one that unites disparate voices against the injustice of forced evictions. The takeaway for Nigeria—and indeed the world—is that when human rights are under threat anywhere, solidarity and action can spark change everywhere.
