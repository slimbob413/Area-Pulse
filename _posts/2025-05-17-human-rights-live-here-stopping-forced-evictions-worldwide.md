**Human rights live here**: a rallying cry against forced evictions is resonating across nations.

- **Global movement** Human rights live here aims to stop forced evictions.
- **Significant implications** for Nigerian communities at risk.
- **Advocates for** legal reforms and greater protection of housing rights.

In recent years, the Human rights live here campaign has gained international traction, challenging the practice of forced evictions which displace individuals and communities without adequate legal recourse or compensation. In Nigeria, where urban development and infrastructure projects often lead to evictions, the movement's message is particularly resonant.

Forced evictions in Nigeria often occur without proper consultation or provision for those affected, leading to homelessness and violations of human dignity. Activists within the Human rights live here movement are not only spotlighting these injustices but are also pushing for policy changes that respect and protect the rights to adequate housing.

Why it matters for Nigerians is clear: stable housing is foundational to the exercise of other human rights, including education, health, and privacy. The campaign is a beacon of hope for communities facing the threat of eviction, advocating for a future where development does not come at the cost of human rights.

>An authoritative voice in the movement, Nneka Okereke, a human rights lawyer, tells Sahara Reporters, "We must place the dignity and rights of Nigerian citizens at the forefront of urban development. Housing is not just a commodity; it's a human right."

The take-away for Nigerians: the Human rights live here initiative is more than a slogan; it's a potent defense against the disruption and disenfranchisement wrought by forced evictions.
