A global initiative is taking a stand against forced evictions, advocating for the basic human right to adequate housing. The movement, 'Human rights live here', has resonated with activists and policymakers worldwide, including Nigeria, where forced evictions are not uncommon, often leading to humanitarian crises. In a country grappling with rapid urbanization and weak housing rights enforcement, the initiative's mission to halt unjust evictions is particularly relevant.

In Nigeria, forced evictions often disrupt the lives of the most vulnerable, pushing them further into poverty and destitution. The 'Human rights live here' campaign is mobilizing resources and international attention to pressure governments and corporations to respect and uphold housing rights. "Forced evictions are not just a violation of human rights; they're an affront to human dignity, and we must fight them with unwavering solidarity," stated a representative from Amnesty International, highlighting the urgency and moral imperative of the campaign.

Through its efforts, 'Human rights live here' is not only spotlighting the issue but also fostering a growing network of advocates committed to policy reform and enforcement. It exemplifies how global solidarity can inspire change, with Nigeria being a key battleground for securing the right to a home for all.
