In a world where forced evictions threaten the dignity of millions, the mantra "Human rights live here" has never been more pivotal in the fight to protect vulnerable communities globally, including Nigeria.

In Nigeria, forced evictions often leave thousands homeless, stripping them of their rights and livelihoods. This practice is not only a violation of human rights but also contravenes international law. The "who" includes Nigerian citizens, particularly in low-income and informal settlements, who are often the victims of these human rights infringements. The "what" involves the unlawful or arbitrary eviction of individuals from their homes without due process, legal justification, or adequate notice and compensation.

Why it matters for Nigerians is a question of basic human dignity and the stability of communities. Forced evictions exacerbate poverty, lead to loss of education and healthcare access, and often result in conflicts. "Forced evictions represent a grave breach of human rights. It is essential for governments to recognize and address the long-term harm they cause to individuals and society as a whole," says Dr. Agnes Callamard, Secretary-General of Amnesty International.

The issue of forced evictions is not just a local problem but a global concern with crucial implications for the respect of human rights and the realization of sustainable development goals. As a nation, Nigeria has the opportunity to set a precedent in safeguarding the rights of its citizens by standing against forced evictions.

The takeaway is clear: In the pursuit of progress, Nigeria's commitment to human rights must not waver, ensuring that every Nigerian has a place to call home, free from the threat of forced eviction.
