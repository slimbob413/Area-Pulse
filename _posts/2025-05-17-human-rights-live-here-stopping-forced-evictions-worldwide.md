Human rights live here has become a global mantra in the fight against forced evictions.

- **Human rights live here** initiative is gaining traction globally.
- It provides legal and logistical support to prevent forced evictions.
- The campaign is particularly resonant for Nigerians facing similar threats.

Forced evictions are a grave violation of human rights, often leaving vulnerable populations homeless and destitute. The **Human rights live here** initiative is a concerted effort bringing together activists, legal experts, and international organizations to halt this practice worldwide. With a focus on legal recourse and public advocacy, the campaign has successfully stopped numerous evictions, providing a blueprint for communities at risk.

In Nigeria, forced evictions are not uncommon, with the government and private developers sometimes displacing individuals and entire communities for various projects. The relevance of this initiative cannot be overstated as it offers hope and practical assistance to those who face the threat of losing their homes. By collaborating with local NGOs, the initiative ensures that the rights of Nigerians are safeguarded.

> "The success of **Human rights live here** is a testament to the power of solidarity and legal action in protecting the disenfranchised," says Amina Jibril, a human rights lawyer and contributor to the Guardian Nigeria.

This global campaign's impact in Nigeria demonstrates the necessity of international cooperation in addressing human rights violations related to housing. It also underscores the power of collective action in challenging unjust practices and policies.
