Human rights live here, acting as a shield against forced evictions worldwide.

- **Human rights organizations are campaigning to stop forced evictions globally.**
- **Forced evictions in Nigeria are a critical issue, affecting thousands of citizens.**
- **Nigerians are looking to global movements to support local advocacy.**

Forced evictions represent a grave violation of human rights, and the campaign "Human rights live here" has galvanized global efforts to halt this practice. In Nigeria, forced evictions are not uncommon, often targeting the most vulnerable populations living in informal settlements. These actions not only displace individuals and families but also lead to wider social and economic disruptions.

The Nigerian context is particularly poignant, with cities like Lagos experiencing rapid urbanization and development pressures that lead to frequent clashes over land rights. The "Human rights live here" initiative matters to Nigerians because it strengthens the voices of local activists and provides an international framework for advocacy and legal resistance against forced evictions.

> "The fight against forced evictions is not just about preserving homes; it's about upholding the dignity and rights of every individual," says Amina J. Mohammed, United Nations Deputy Secretary-General.

For Nigerians, the fight against forced evictions is not merely a housing issue but a broader struggle for human rights and social justice. The global spotlight on the matter offers hope and a pathway for more robust protections and policies within Nigeria.
