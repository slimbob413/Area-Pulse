In the global fight against injustice, the mantra "Human rights live here" is becoming a shield against forced evictions worldwide. For Nigerians, the rise of forced evictions represents not just a loss of shelter but a profound violation of human rights. The disruption of communities and the disenfranchisement of the most vulnerable populations underscore the urgent need for attention and action.

What is at stake here is the basic dignity and security of countless individuals. Forced evictions—often without proper notice, legal recourse, or adequate compensation—tear apart communities, erode cultural identities, and push families into cycles of poverty. In Nigeria, rapid urban development and infrastructure projects have frequently led to such evictions, disregarding the livelihoods and rights of residents.

Why it matters for Nigerians is clear: these evictions are not just about land and property, but about the respect for human dignity and the rule of law. "The fight against forced evictions is a fight for the soul of our nation, where every citizen's rights are respected and protected," says Prof. Yemi Akinseye-George, SAN, a renowned Nigerian human rights lawyer.

As activists, policymakers, and global citizens rally under the banner of human rights to prevent forced evictions, the message is clear: no development can be deemed sustainable or just if it comes at the cost of basic human rights. The takeaway for Nigeria is that as we forge our path towards progress, we must ensure that human rights are not just a slogan, but the foundation of our growth and development.
