MTN Foundation has earmarked over N3bn for scholarships in Nigeria, doubling down on education with its 2025 programme now open.

The 15-year push has backed 14,728 students, targeting STEM talent, disabled learners, and top exam scorers, the telecoms giant said in a statement to The PUNCH.

The scholarship programme, which is now accepting applications, comprises three distinct categories: the Science and Technology Scholarship, the MTN Scholarship for Blind Students, and the Top 10 UTME Scholarship.

These cater for 300-level STEM students with a CGPA of 3.5 and above, blind students in 200-level with a CGPA of at least 2.5, and the highest scorers in the JAMB Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, respectively.

Executive Director of MTN Foundation, Odunayo Sanya, said, “Education is the backbone of national development, and at MTN Foundation, we are committed to ensuring that no bright mind is left behind due to financial constraints.

“This scholarship is not just about funding education; it is about investing in Nigeria’s future leaders, innovators, and problem-solvers.”

In 2024, MTN Foundation increased the annual scholarship value from N200,000 to N300,000, with beneficiaries receiving support until graduation, provided they meet the academic requirements.

The programme also integrates mentorship, internship placements, and digital certification training to boost employability.
